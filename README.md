* NIS-8016 Lab A

* code:
    * Recv.grc/py: Receive signals and match with ASK button using HackRF and GNU radio. I use AM demod block(can also instrumented using math blocks) and manually set the threshold to transfer the analogue signal to digital signal. 
    * Send.grc/py: Send signals using vector source deocded manually
    * EasySend.grc/py: A simple version of Send.grc
    * Decode.grc/py: Decode signals following ASK/OOK coding rules

* [data](https://jbox.sjtu.edu.cn/l/610CT9):

    * *.txt: Manually decoded bit vector of ASK/OOK signals
    * *.cf32: Complex format signals received by HackRF, can be analyzed by inspectrum
    * *.bin: Binary format stream generated by Recv.grc, follows the same pattern with *.txt 

* [video](https://jbox.sjtu.edu.cn/l/V10NC2):
    * demo.mp4: Show how I work on with these scripts and data 
    * send.mp4: Show how I use HackRF to send ASK/OOK signals and then received by Arduino
    * recv.mp4: Show how I use HackRF to receive ASK/OOK signals send by Arduin
    * sendv2.mp4: Using EasySend.grc
